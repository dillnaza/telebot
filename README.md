The bot provides the following commands:

1. `/start`: Getting started with the bot. The bot greets the user by name, if it is specified in the Telegram profile.

2. `/help`: Shows a list of all available commands and their descriptions.

3. `/find_age`: Calculates the user's age based on the year of birth.

4. `/find_animal`: Defines the symbol of the "Eastern Animal Calendar" based on the year of birth.

5. `/find_zodiac`: Determines the user's zodiac sign based on the date of birth.

### Usage

2. Open Telegram and find your bot by its name or click `/start` to start using the bot.

3. Follow the instructions of the bot to calculate the age, determine the symbol from the "Eastern calendar of animals" or determine the zodiac sign.

## Code structure

The code is divided into several functional parts:

- `@bot.message_handler(commands=['start'])` and `@bot.message_handler(commands=['help'])`: Command handlers `/start` and `/help`, which output a welcome message and a list of commands, respectively.

- `@bot.message_handler(commands=['find_age'])` and `@bot.message_handler(commands=['find_animal'])`: Command handlers `/find_age` and `/find_animal`, which run processes to calculate the age and determine the symbol of the "Eastern Calendar of Animals".

- `get_year_for_age(message)` and `get_year(message)`: Functions for getting the user's year of birth and performing the corresponding calculations.

- `@bot.message_handler(commands=['find_zodiac'])`, `get_day(message)`, and `get_month(message)`: Handlers of the `/find_zodiac` command and functions for getting the user's date of birth and determining the zodiac sign.
